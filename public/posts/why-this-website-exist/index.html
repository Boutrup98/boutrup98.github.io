A while ago, I came across the idea of the Small Web. Unlike the ad-driven, corporate-dominated Big Web, the Small Web is built around personal websites, blogs, and projects that you stumble upon through recommendations, links, or curiosity, not algorithms.

<p>The web today often feels less like a place of discovery and more like a competition for your attention. Algorithms, notifications, and engagement metrics shape much of what we see and do online. As a designer, I’ve been part of this system—my work is frequently judged by how well it captures attention. It’s effective, but it can also feel like a double-edged sword.</p>
<p>A while ago, I came across the idea of the Small Web. Unlike the ad-driven, corporate-dominated Big Web, the Small Web is built around personal websites, blogs, and projects that you stumble upon through recommendations, links, or curiosity, not algorithms. What I love about it is the sense of exploration: you find things because you want to, not because something is trying to keep you scrolling.</p>
<p>I think the internet is healthiest when both the Big Web and the Small Web coexist. But when it came time to update my own portfolio, I knew I wanted to contribute to the Small Web. This site is my attempt to create a minimal, lightweight website where I can share projects and ideas on my own terms.</p>
<p>It’s built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, based on a customized version of the beautiful <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/shibui/">Shibui (渋い)</a> theme by Kien Nguyen Tuan. The content is managed with <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>, inspired by the structure of <a href="https://stephango.com/">Steph Ango</a>. I wrote the code in <a href="https://cursor.com/">Cursor</a> and it’s hosted on <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages">GitHub Pages</a>. There are no tracking scripts, no pop-ups, no infinite scroll, and no recommendation engines trying to keep you hooked—just a simple site designed to stay out of the way.</p>
